   <center><h2>⚓<strong>Narrative</strong>⚓</h2></center>

  <p>In 1802, the merchant ship Obra Dinn set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea. Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages (note 1).</p>

  <p>The player is the insurance investigator tasked by not only the East India Company but also Henry Evans, a former crewmember of the ship, to discover what befell the people on board. Evans grants the player a logbook journal as well as a <i>Memento Mortem</i> pocketwatch to view the last moments of the passengers and crew. There are 60 fates to be explored. The voyage is split into ten chapters which tell a linear story in a non-linear fashion, starting with "Chapter X: The End."</p>

  <p>The logbook can be sent back to the Company and Evans without being fully complete. If too many fates are unknown, it will be considered a failure. If all fates that can be solved (as the "Bargin" chapter is locked for the time being), the player </p>

  <center><h2>⚓<strong>Joys in Confirmations</strong>⚓</h2></center>

  <p>At its core, <i>Return of the Obra Dinn</i> is an adventure that pairs exploration and observations with logical deductions. Clues can and will be both auditory and visual. Each scene starts with a ending snippet of a conversation had before a death occurs, as heard in the first scene:</p>

<center><audio controls>

</audio></center>

  <p>From there, the player will be launched into a freeze-frame of the corpse's final moment. They can wander around in a limited manner and observe the scene. There are some closed doors that can be interacted with, but for the most part, the player is simply a ghost in the unchanging past. Some scenes are larger than others, but the ship is never fully accessible while in the past. The game opens up the ship's holds as more and more deaths are witnessed, guiding the player through the narrative without overwhelming them. As different scenes become accessible and more of the story is revealed, it simultaneously gets easier and harder to search for clues and solve fates. Many clues are not direct and are often hidden as small details of the environment.</p>

  <p>Fates and identities are confirmed in threes to prevent guessing through the whole game (although some can be solved via the process of elimination; I will admit there were two people I had to, for lack of a better word, 'brute force' their names/fates.). When three fates are correctly solved, a version of this cutscene and audio plays:</p>

  <p>Ernest Lindley claims that people are drawn to puzzles because of the joy and pleasure that comes from triumphing over obstacles to achieve victory. That immediate completion joy, however, is not the sole motivator. The so-called pleasurable idea of overcoming difficulties in order to achieve victory is the prominent motivation with the joy and continuation of the puzzle being secondary (note 2). When I was playing the game, I legitimately felt that joy, that pleasure, rush through me every time I would get confirmation of correct fates. It was exhilarating, especially when I wasn't expecting the cutscene or was unsure about the names/fates I had selected.</p>

  <p>By adding in that cutscene and sound effects, it not only helps the player to understand that they're on the right track, but it also gives them a rush of pleasure in overcoming obstacles. It acts as a checkpoint that feeds both the triumph-pleasure of achieving little pieces of success and the joy of completion while also prompting them to continue solving the puzzles to the end. This association creates a psychological impact on the player which urges them to continue the puzzle even if they're not interested in the actual plot behind the demise of the ship. For me, while I was interested in what happened to the characters and the ship, I was much more focused on the solving aspect of it, not the storytelling (which is not to say that it's not an interesting story).</p>
  
  <p>It took me a little under ten hours over three days to complete the game in its entirety. It took over a lot of my thoughts during those days. All I wanted to do while working was solve the mystery of this ship and the people on board. The story cannot be separated from the game's goal of filling the logbook, but it's not what I focused on when looking around the past; rather, I wanted to keep visiting past moments and see <i>what I was missing</i>.</p>

  <p>For example, there was one fate left for me to solve. I knew the others were correct, but there was something about his that was wrong. His name was correct, that much I knew, but I needed to figure out what detail I overlooked.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, while it is a great game, it can only be truly experienced once. Its replay value diminishes the longer the game is played and if all fates are solved, there's little to no reason to go back (unless you're using it for an assignment or watching someone else play it for the first time). After something is known about this game, it's very difficult to play it without that information haunting each choice. The thrill of unraveling the mysteries of this game is something unlike most games I have experienced before. There are plot twists awaiting behind each corpse, even if some are more subtle and not as jarring as others.</p>
  
  <!-- Lindley, A Study of Puzzles: pg 433, "This "Freude an Ursache- sein," in last analysis, may be pleasure in triumphing over obstacles, the joy in success, victory." / pg 436, "Instead of the mere pleasure in activity continuing to furnish the sole motive, joy in being a cause, pleasure in triumphing over difficulties may become prominent." -->

  <center><h2>⚓<strong>Minimal Music Musings</strong>⚓</h2></center>

  <p>When the player first enters the present-day ship, there is no music. The only sound design is the splashing of the waves, the creaking of the wood, and the whistling of the wind through of what's left of the sails (and a small conversation between the inspector and the old boatman).</p>

  <p>This sets the tone and also signals to the player that they're in the present. It helps with the immersion, especially in the beginning. </p>

  <p>After the player uses the pocketwatch on a corpse, either part A or B of the chapter's song will play after the ending conversation. Averaging around one minute per part, it plays with enough time for the player to get a somewhat glancing look at everything before the door opens that allows them to leave the memory. If the player revisits a corpse, the one-minute song will still play before it switches to a quiet heartbeat-like noise:</p>
