  <p>In 1802, the merchant ship Obra Dinn set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea. Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port at Falmouth with damaged sails and no visible crew. As insurance investigator for the East India Company's London Office, dispatch immediately to Falmouth, find means to board the ship, and prepare an assessment of damages (note 1).</p>

  <p>The player is the insurance investigator tasked by not only the East India Company but also Henry Evans, a former crewmember of the ship, to discover what befell the people on board. Evans grants the player a logbook journal as well as a <i>Memento Mortem</i> pocketwatch to view the last moments of the passengers and crew. There are 60 fates to be explored. The voyage is split into ten chapters which tell a linear story in a non-linear fashion.</p>

  <p>At its core, <i>Obra Dinn</i> is an adventure that pairs exploration and observations with logical deductions. Clues can and will be both auditory and visual. Each scene starts with a ending snippet of a conversation had before a death occurs, as heard in the first scene:</p>

  <!-- INSERT BEGINNING CONVO SNIPPET
  <center><audio controls>
  <source src="[AUDIO].[FORMAT]" type="audio/ogg">
</audio></center> -->

  <p>Fates and identities are confirmed in threes to prevent guessing through the whole game (although some can be solved via the process of elimination). When they are completed, this cutscene and audio plays:</p>

  <!-- INSERT COMPLETION OF FIRST THREE FATES -->

  <p>Ernest Lindley claims that people are drawn to puzzles because of the joy and pleasure that comes from triumphing over obstacles to achieve victory. That immediate completion joy, however, is not the sole motivator. The so-called pleasurable idea of overcoming difficulties in order to achieve victory is the prominent motivation with the joy and continuation of the puzzle being secondary (note 2). When I was playing the game, I legitimately felt that joy, that pleasure, rush through me every time I would get confirmation of correct fates. It was exhilarating, especially when I wasn't expecting the cutscene or was unsure about the names/fates I had selected.</p>

  <p>By adding in this cutscene and sound effects, it not only helps the player to understand that they're on the right track, but it also gives them a rush of pleasure in overcoming obstacles. It acts as a checkpoint that feeds both the triumph-pleasure of achieving little pieces of success and the joy of completion while also prompting them to continue solving the puzzles to the end. This association creates a psychological impact on the player which urges them to continue the puzzle even if they're not interested in the actual plot behind the demise of the ship. For me, while I was interested in what happened to the characters and the ship, I was much more focused on the solving aspect of it, not the storytelling (which is not to say that it's not an interesting story).</p>
  
  <!-- Lindley, A Study of Puzzles: pg 433, "This "Freude an Ursache- sein," in last analysis, may be pleasure in triumphing over obstacles, the joy in success, victory." / pg 436, "Instead of the mere pleasure in activity continuing to furnish the sole motive, joy in being a cause, pleasure in triumphing over difficulties may become prominent." -->
